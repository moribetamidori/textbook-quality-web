{%block content %}
Think step by step to continue writing this detailed textbook on {{topic}}. You will write the next {{sections_to_author}} {{section_str}} of the outline.

Each section is made up of content blocks. Include the following blocks:
{{component_extras|join('\n')}}

 Write concisely, remove unnecessary transitions, and get straight to the point. Make the language informal and friendly. For example, instead of saying "However, you will need to be prepared.", say "You'll need to prepare."

{%if research_notes %}
You've written research notes for the textbook that may be useful reference materials.  They're surrounded with ``` to separate them from the rest of the textbook. Do not include a research notes section in the final textbook.
{%endif%}

Write the textbook in markdown, with blocks separated by --- like the examples below. Write the next {{sections_to_author}} {{section_str}} of the outline. Start from the section shown below.  Do not start sections by describing what the student will learn.  Do not say "In this section, we will, ...", or "In this textbook, we will". Simply write the learning material without any summaries or introductions.
